    "### AIC and DIC\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to model selection is to use an information-theoretic criterion to identify the most appropriate model. Akaike (1973) found a formal relationship between Kullback-Leibler information (a dominant paradigm in information and coding theory) and likelihood theory. **Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)** is an estimator of expected relative K-L information based on the maximized log-likelihood function, corrected for asymptotic bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC} = −2 \\log(L(\\theta|data)) + 2K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "AIC balances the **fit of the model** (in terms of the likelihood) with the **number of parameters** required to achieve that fit. We can easily calculate AIC from the residual sums of squares as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC} = n \\log(\\text{RSS}/n) + 2k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the number of parameters in the model. Notice that as the number of parameters increase, the residual sum of squares goes down, but the second term (a penalty) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of AIC for Bayesian models is that it cannot be applied to hierarchical models (or any models with random effects), as counting the number of parameters in such models is problematic. A more Bayesian version of AIC is called the **deviance information criterion (DIC)**, and replaces the fixed parameter penalty with an estimate of the effective number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{DIC} = 2\\left(\\log p(y | E[\\theta | y]) - E_{post}[\\log p(y|\\theta)] \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the second term is an average of $\\theta$ over the posterior distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{p}_{DIC} = 2\\left(\\log p(y | E[\\theta | y]) - \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M}\\log p(y|\\theta^{(j)}) \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "DIC is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{DIC} = -2 \\log p(y | E[\\theta | y]) + 2p_{DIC}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this is an improvement over AIC, DIC is still not fully Bayesian, as it relies on a **point estimate** of the model rather than using the full posterior. As a result, it can be unstable for hierarchical models, sometimes producing estimates of effective number of parameters that is negative."

    "2. The second column contains the **values of WAIC**. The DataFrame is always sorted from lowest to highest WAIC. The index reflects the order in which the models are passed to this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third column is the estimated **effective number of parameters**. In general, models with more parameters will be more flexible to fit data and at the same time could also lead to overfitting. Thus we can interpret pWAIC as a penalization term, intuitively we can also interpret it as measure of how flexible each model is in fitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The fourth column is the **difference between the value of WAIC for the top-ranked model and the value of WAIC for each model**. For this reason we will always get a value of 0 for the first model. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The fifth column contains **model weights**. Sometimes when comparing models, we do not want to select the \"best\" model, instead we want to perform predictions by averaging along all the models (or at least several models). Ideally we would like to perform a weighted average, giving more weight to the model that seems to explain/predict the data better. There are many approaches to perform this task, one of them is to use Akaike weights based on the values of WAIC for each model. These weights can be loosely interpreted as the probability of each model (among the compared models) given the data. One caveat of this approach is that the weights are based on point estimates of WAIC (i.e. the uncertainty is ignored).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The sixth column records the **standard error for the WAIC computations**. The standard error can be useful to assess the uncertainty of the WAIC estimates. Nevertheless, caution need to be taken because the estimation of the standard error assumes normality and hence could be problematic when the sample size is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. dSE is the **standard error of the difference** in IC between each model and the top-ranked model. It’s always 0 for the top-ranked model. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. The second-last column is a flag for **warnings**. A value of `True` indicates that the computation of WAIC may not be reliable, this warning is based on an empirical determined cutoff value and need to be interpreted with caution. For more details you can read this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04544).\n",

    "### Leave-one-out Cross-validation (LOO)\n",
    "\n",
    "LOO cross-validation is another estimate of the **out-of-sample predictive fit**. In cross-validation, the data are repeatedly partitioned into training and holdout sets, iteratively fitting the model with the former and evaluating the fit with the holdout data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The estimate of out-of-sample predictive fit from applying LOO cross-validation to a Bayesian model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$lppd_{loo} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log p_{post(-i)}(y_i) =  \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^S p(y_i| \\theta^{(is)})\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so, each prediction is conditioned on $N-1$ data points, which induces an **underestimation of the predictive fit** for smaller $N$. The resulting estimate of effective samples size is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{loo} = lppd - lppd_{loo}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, using cross-validation for a Bayesian model, fitting $N$ copies of the model under different subsets of the data is computationally expensive. However, Vehtari *et al.* (2016) introduced an efficient computation of LOO from MCMC sample, which are corrected using **Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS)** to provide an estimate of point-wise out-of-sample prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves estimating the importance sampling LOO predictive distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\tilde{y}_i | y_{-i}) \\approx \\frac{\\sum_{s=1}^S w_i(\\theta^{(s)}) p(\\tilde{y}_i|\\theta^{(s)})}{\\sum_{s=1}^S w_i(\\theta^{(s)})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the importance weights are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_i(\\theta^{(s)}) = \\frac{1}{p(y_i | \\theta^{(s)})} \\propto \\frac{p(\\theta^{(s)}|y_{-i})}{p(\\theta^{(s)}|y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive distribution evaluated at the held-out point is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(y_i | y_{-i}) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^S \\frac{1}{p(y_i | \\theta^{(s)})}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the posterior is likely to have a *smaller variance and thinner tails* than the LOO posteriors, so this approximation induces instability due to the fact that the importance ratios can have high or infinite variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with this instability, a generalized **Pareto distribution** fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the importance ratios can be used to construct a test for a finite importance ratio variance. If the test suggests the variance is infinite then importance sampling is halted."
