    "In Bayesian analysis, the most common strategy for computing posterior quantities is through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Despite recent advances in efficient sampling, MCMC methods still remain computationally intensive for more than a few thousand observations. A more scalable alternative to sampling is Variational Inference (VI), which re-frames the problem of computing the posterior distribution as a minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and a member of some approximating family. \n",
