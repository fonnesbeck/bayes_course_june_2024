PyTensor is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize/rewrite, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.

There are a number of approaches for conducting variable selection, but a popular automated method is *regularization*, whereby ineffective covariates are shrunk towards zero via regularization (a form of penalization) if they do not contribute to predicting outcomes. \n",

    "You may have heard of regularization from machine learning or classical statistics applications, where methods like the lasso or ridge regression shrink parameters towards zero by applying a penalty to the size of the regression parameters. In a Bayesian context, we apply an appropriate prior distribution to the regression coefficients. One such prior is the *hierarchical regularized horseshoe*, which uses two regularization strategies, one global and a set of local local parameters, one for each coefficient. The key to making this work is by selecting a long-tailed distribution as the shrinkage prior, which allows some to be nonzero, while pushing the rest towards zero.\n",
