    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference begins with specification of a probability model relating unknown variables to data. PyMC provides the basic building blocks for Bayesian probability models: stochastic random variables, deterministic variables, and factor potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **stochastic random variable** is a factor whose value is not completely determined by its parents, while the value of a **deterministic random variable** is entirely determined by its parents. Most models can be constructed using only these two variable types. The third quantity, the **factor potential**, is *not* a variable but simply a\n",

    "\n",
    "A stochastic variable is represented in PyMC by a `Distribution` class. This structure adds functionality to Pytensor's `pytensor.tensor.random.op.RandomVariable` class, mainly by registering it with an associated PyMC `Model`. As we demonstrated in a previous section, `Distribution` objects are only usable inside of a `Model` context.\n",

    ":   Numeric or symbolic untransformed initial value of matching shape, or one of the following initial value strategies: \"moment\", \"prior\". Depending on the sampler's settings, a random jitter may be added to numeric, symbolic or moment-based initial values in the transformed space.\n",

    ":   The PyMC model to which the variable belongs.\n",
    "\n",

    "As we previewed in the introduction, `Distribution` has a classmethod `dist` that returns a **stateless** probability distribution of that type; that is, without being wrapped in a PyMC random variable object. Sometimes we wish to use a particular statistical distribution, without using it as a variable in a model; for example, to generate random numbers from the distribution. "

There are a number of approaches for conducting variable selection, but a popular automated method is *regularization*, whereby ineffective covariates are shrunk towards zero via regularization (a form of penalization) if they do not contribute to predicting outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard of regularization from machine learning or classical statistics applications, where methods like the lasso or ridge regression shrink parameters towards zero by applying a penalty to the size of the regression parameters. In a Bayesian context, we apply an appropriate prior distribution to the regression coefficients. One such prior is the *hierarchical regularized horseshoe*, which uses two regularization strategies, one global and a set of local local parameters, one for each coefficient. The key to making this work is by selecting a long-tailed distribution as the shrinkage prior, which allows some to be nonzero, while pushing the rest towards zero.\n",

To aid in reproducibility (and debugging), it can be helpful to set a **random number seed** prior to sampling. The `random_seed` argument can be used to set PyMC's random number generator to a particular seed integer, which results in the same sequence of random numbers each time the seed is set to the same value."

Significantly, BlackJAX and NumPyro can both be used because in PyMC the modeling language is decoupled from the inference methods; BlackJAX and NumPyro only require a log-probability density function written in JAX. This demonstrates that samplers can be developed independently of PyMC and then be made available to users of the library.\n",

    "## Imputation of Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most textbook examples, the models we have examined so far assume that the associated data are complete. That is, there are no **missing values** corresponding to any observations in the dataset. However, many real-world datasets have missing observations, usually due to some logistical problem during the data collection process. The easiest way of dealing with observations that contain missing values is simply to exclude them from the analysis. However, this results in loss of information if an excluded observation contains valid values for other quantities, and can bias results. An alternative is to impute the missing values, based on information in the rest of the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each row contains the number of individuals seen during the survey, along with three covariates: the site on which the survey was conducted, the observer that collected the data, and the temperature during the survey. If we are interested in modelling, say, population size as a function of the count and the associated covariates, it is difficult to accommodate the second observation because the temperature is missing (perhaps the thermometer was broken that day). Ignoring this observation will allow us to fit the model, but it wastes information that is contained in the other covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Bayesian modelling framework, missing data are accommodated simply by treating them as **unknown model parameters**. Values for the missing data $\\tilde{y}$ are estimated naturally, using the posterior predictive distribution:\n",
